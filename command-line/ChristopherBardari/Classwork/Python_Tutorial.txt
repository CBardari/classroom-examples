# Corey Schafer's Python Tutorial for Beginners

Corey Schafer has an excellent [python tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7). Watch each video and take notes in this file.

As you watch the video, have a code editor open and type out what Corey types. Run the code and modify the code. Do this even if you don't *yet* understand what is happening.

The videos are on average 20 minutes long. Commit to watching one video after school for the first two weeks. **This tutorial is meant to serve as an introduction and to show you what is possible in a programming language**. Understanding and mastery come from daily practice.

## 1: Install and Setup for Mac and Windows

## 2: Strings - Working with Textual Data

1. What is a variable?
    - a variable is essentially a storage bin for data which is used to more easily access said data 
2. Why are good variable names important?
    - good variable names are important because they make it easier to analyze code and gives the reader a sense of what the variables are supposed to do
3. What is a string?
    - a string is a variable which is used to store a string of characters/ used to hold multiple characters
4. What are square brackets used for?
    - square brackets are used to capture specific characters when used in tandem with a string
5. What is an index?
    - an index is the position of a character within a string
6. How do you slice a string?
    - a string is a specific part of a string, a string is sliced by putting square brackets after a string and putting numbers in those brackets.
7. What is a function/method?
    - a method/function is a block of code that performs a certain task
8. List a few useful string methods.
    - lower()
    - upper()
    - .count()
    - .find()
    - .replace()
    - .format()
9. What is concatenation?
    - Combining strings together 
10. How do you format text with `.format()`?
    - StringC = ‘{}, {}. How are you?’.format(StringA, StringB)
    - format uses {} as place holders for variables and also uses raw text within the quotes
11. How do you format text with "f-strings"?
    - StringC = f’{StringA}, {StringB}. How are you?’
    - fstrings use {Variable Name} as place holders for variables and also uses raw text within the quotes
12. What do the `dir()` and `help()` functions do?
    - dir() will print all the methods available that can be used on the variable
    - help() will print what all the methods do for a specific type of variable
    - help(str.lower()) will print what the lower method does for the string variable

## 3: Integers and Floats - Working with Numeric Data
1. What does the `type()` function do?
2. What is a `float`?
3. What is the operator for:
    - Multiplication?
    - Division?
    - Floor division?
    - Exponent?
    - Modulus?
4. What does modulus (`%`) do?
5. How does Python handle the order of operations?
6. List the comparison operators:
    - Equal to: `==`
    - ...
    - ...
    - ...
    - ...
    - ...
7. Is `"105"` an integer or a string? Explain.

## 4: Lists, Tuples, and Sets
1. How do you get the last item in a list or string?
2. How do you slice a list?
3. How do you add things to a list? Talk about `.append`, `.sort`, and `.extend`.
4. How do you remove elements from a list?  Talk about `.remove`, `.pop`.
5. What are two ways to reverse a list? What is the difference?
6. What are two ways to sort a list? What is the difference?
